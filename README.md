# Description 

Our objective for this project was to refactor the code to make it more accessible and optimized for search engines. This was accomplished by clearly commenting the functions of each piece of code as well as replacing non-semantic elements such as Div tags, with semantic elements such as nav, or section. Further, the CSS has been cleaned by not repeating code (DRY). All changes have been labeled along with the functions of each element. The experience gained from this process includes but not limited to; making sites accessible and easier to navigate for users and computers, commenting, the placement of semantic elements and why they are so important.
